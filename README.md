# my-Pet-Bird

My Pet Bird Project is part of a competition to write a program to predict if the pet bird is at home or not.

The Bird Program
    Our pet bird lives on a tree (a hole)
    Our pet bird have the following characteristics (sleeps, plays, search for food/water, eats and some other activities
    which not sure what it is)

    Life expectancy - unpredictable

    What the bird is doing at different times and if the bird is at home or not: 

    See the following the Scenarios below

    - 30% Sleeping – most likely at home 80% at home
    - 15% Eating – most likely outside but can be at home 70% Outside
    - 25% Looking for food – outside 100%
    - 10% Playing – can be both 90% Outside
    - 20% Others – can be both 80% Outside

The predictor Porgram

    Can we predict at 3 PM in the afternoon, the bird is at home or not?

    If it is a probability, how accurate are we?

    How long do we need to learn to be 100% sure?

    The goal is to predict accurately if the bird is at home or outside at 3pm.

    What is the best architecture to achieve a high level of accuracy most efficiently?
